             STREVDE is a work in progress and the public login feature is not yet done.
          </p>
          <p>
            STREVDE combines multiple Strava activities into a single, shareable page, displaying a combined map, related photos and activity details.
            The idea is to provide a single address for a complete trip - making it easy to share the trip with friends and fellow
            athletes and travellers.
          </p>
          <p>This is a one man project at the moment, so any help is much appreciated. Feel free to reach out on
